# Q1-Project

This project is a news aggregator that takes the latest stories from various news sites and shows them side-by-side for easy comparison. The site pulls data from the https://newsapi.org/ and displays it dynamically using cards to be readable and concise.

## Problem to Solve

This technology aims to help with the problem of selective perception in media by providing a user with multiple sources of information that are generally reputable, side by side. This allows for greater perspective on how stories are being framed.

## Technology

The technologies used on this project are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, and Bootstrap. 

## MVP goal

My MVP goal is a single-page application that displays the latest stories from four World News organizations.

## Strech goals

My stretch goals, thusfar, are:
1. Adding more categories, such as Science, Tech, and Sports.
2. Adding a button for a random story.
3. The ability to filter news sources by language.
