# Q1-Project

This news aggregator takes the latest stories from various world news sites and shows the latest stories of one leading news provider side-by-side the latest stories of another provider. For instance, the latest AP, Reuters, BBC, and Washington Post articles all displayed on one page. The site will pull data from the https://newsapi.org/ and display it in Bootstrap cards so it is readable and concise.

## Problem to Solve

This technology aims to help with the problem of selective perception in media by providing a user with multiple sources of information that are generally reputable, side by side. This allows for greater perspective on how stories are being framed.

## Technology

I will be using the technologies of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, and Bootstrap. 

## MVP goal

My MVP goal is a single-page application that displays the latest stories from four World News organizations.

## Strech goals

My stretch goals, thusfar, are:
1. Adding more categories, such as Science, Tech, and Sports.
2. Adding a button for a random story.
3. The ability to filter news sources by language.
